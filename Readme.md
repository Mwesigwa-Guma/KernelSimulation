# Kernel Simulation in User Space

This project aims to implement a kernel simulation in user space. The goal is to create a simulated environment that mimics the behavior of a kernel, allowing for experimentation and learning without the need for modifying actual kernel code.

## Features

- Simulated process scheduling
- Memory management
- Inter-process communication
- File system simulation

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the `INSTALL.md` file.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/KernelSimulation.git
cd KernelSimulation
```

## Usage

Run the simulation using the following command:

```bash
./simulate
```
